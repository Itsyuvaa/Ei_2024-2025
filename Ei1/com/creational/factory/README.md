Operating System Simulation

Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the Factory design pattern to create and manage different types of operating systems. The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to instantiate objects without exposing the creation logic to the client. It helps in managing and abstracting the creation of objects based on specific conditions.

Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

OperatingSystem Interface: Defines the common operations that all operating systems must implement, such as start and shutdown.

Concrete Operating System Classes: Implementations of the OperatingSystem interface, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

OperatingSystemFactory Class: The factory class responsible for creating instances of different operating systems based on the provided type.

Main Class: The main entry point of the application, where users can select and interact with different operating systems.
